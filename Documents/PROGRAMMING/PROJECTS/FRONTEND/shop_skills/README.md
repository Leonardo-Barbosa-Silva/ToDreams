# SHOP SKILLS
This is a React and Redux-based project in which you exemplify a fictional personal skills store, simulating how you might buy something of the sort.

The unique thing about this project is the manual and direct use of Webpack and Babel to create the bundle of project files already transposing JSX to pure JavaScript. That is, we do in this project what commands such as "npx-create-react-app" already create under the surface.
